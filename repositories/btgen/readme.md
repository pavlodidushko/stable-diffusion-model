# BTGen

BTGen is an image generating software (based on [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)).

BTGen is a rethinking of Stable Diffusion and Midjourney’s designs:

* Learned from Stable Diffusion, the software is offline, open source, and free.

* Learned from Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.


BTGen has simplified the installation. Between pressing "download" and generating the first image, the number of needed mouse clicks is strictly limited to less than 3. Minimal GPU memory requirement is 4GB (Nvidia).


# Run

* install python
* pip install -r requirements_versions.txt
* python3 entry_with_update.py


# Minimal Requirement

Below is the minimal requirement for running BTGen locally. If your device capability is lower than this spec, you may not be able to use BTGen locally. (Please let us know, in any case, if your device capability is lower but BTGen still works.)
